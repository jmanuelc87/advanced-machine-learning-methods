Do not modify this part. However, you should be sure to understand it, and comment it, the use of markdown cells is suggested.\n","\n","    - Model Setup: A skeleton code for the RNN model class will be provided. Complete this class and use it to instantiate your model.\n","\n","    - Implementing Accuracy Function: Write a function that takes model predictions and ground truth labels as input and returns the model's accuracy.\n","\n","    - Training Function: Implement a function that performs training on the given model using the AG_NEWS dataset. Your model should achieve an accuracy of at least 80% to get full marks for this part.\n","\n","    - Text Sampling: Write a function that takes a sample text as input and classifies it using your trained model.\n","\n","    - Confusion Matrix: Implement a function to display the confusion matrix for your model on the test data.\n","\n","    - Submission: Submit your completed Jupyter Notebook. Make sure to include a markdown cell at the beginning of the notebook that lists the names of all team members. Teams should consist of 3 to 4 members.\n","    \n","<br>\n","\n","- Evaluation Criteria:\n","\n","    - Correct setup of all the required libraries and modules (10%)\n","    - Code Quality (30%): Your code should be well-organized, clearly commented, and easy to follow. Use also markdown cells for clarity. Comments should be given for all the provided code, this will help you understand its functionality.\n","    \n","   - Functionality (60%):\n","        - All the functions should execute without
